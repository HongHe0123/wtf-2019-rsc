## Feedback and communication

[Issues](https://github.com/jennybc/wtf-2019-rsc/issues) <-- all are encouraged to open issues as we go. This is actually tremendously helpful to us! Examples of issue-worthy thoughts:

  * Glitches in the instructions or materials that we need to fix, for current workshop or future
  * Missing content that we identify
  * Great questions or sidebar discussions that we should consider formalizing and recording
  * Questions that are too specific or technical to answer in real-time
